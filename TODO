# TODO

- We'll need another script that extracts card images as well.

- Extract rulings? This might be useful, although it does not necessarily make
  sense to store them in the same XML files as the card data.

- Split cards: Some sets (like Invasion) use separate multiverse ids for each
  side, which is fine. Other sets (like Apocalypse) have split cards that for
  some reason use the *same* multiverse id for both sides. This is a problem
  because currently only the rules for one side are extracted. In order to
  make this work, we'd need to have a way to fetch the HTML for both sides,
  and somehow assign them different ids.

  Different HTML can be fetched by using a parameter in the URL:

  http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=27166&part=Fi

- Some cards have alternate art versions that have the same multiverse id.
  When we extract images, this will become a problem.
