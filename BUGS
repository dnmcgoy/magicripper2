# Known issues:

- Split cards and flip cards are not extracted correctly yet (unless the two
  parts have different multiverseids, which is sometimes the case).

- In some cases, the flavor text as stored in Gatherer is not completely
  correct (for example, Pikemen in The Dark, which is missing the leading "--"
  before the name of the person quoted).
